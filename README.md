# Static Webpage deployment Udacity

This is a the first project deploying a static website on AWS with the help of Udacity instructors.
I have created a bucket and gave some policies on the permission and made it public so that everyone can access the website on the internet.
here is the link from the bucket http://webhonebucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
and I also created a cloudfront here is the domain name of the cloudfront https://dhd8tyu2v774i.cloudfront.net .
